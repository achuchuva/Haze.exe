  - "Woah, buddy. You good? You probably don't know where you are. I honestly don't
    either. My best guess is it's some sort of computerized hell meant to imprison
    us. \r"
  - "There's no getting outta here unless you've still got all your mental faculties
    intact. This labrynth eats away at people's minds.\r"
  - You should have a map to help you out. Bring it up by toggling R.
  - "The maze is nothing but dead ends. You'll need to find some programs to help
    you make doorways through the walls. They looked like vending machines, last
    I checked. \r"
  - "They'll give you the ability to make holes wherever you want in the maze, as
    long as it isn't obscured by the haze. \r"
  - "They're a one time use each so use them wisely. Otherwise you'll need to pick
    up your entrance and put it somewhere else.\r"
  - Place your entrance wherever you want in front of you, then place your exit on
    the map. Try to ask around for help with clearing the haze first.
  - "The haze is this... sort of fuzz that distorts the map. It's how most of us
    got lost. Only people who've around it long enough know their way through it.\r"
  - "\rYou should try talking to the people. Most of them kind of lost themselves
    but they can help clear up your path. \r"
  - After you've cleared a section of the haze, try placing your exit door there.
    Do that enough times and you may yet find an escape from this digital damnation.
