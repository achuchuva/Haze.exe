  - "Hey, you ok? Take it easy, you've just gotten yourself trapped in the haze.
    There's no hope of getting out of here by yourself. All the hallways eventually
    lead to dead ends.\r"
  - The only way you can get through them is by making a doorway. Find door machines
    scattered across the maze. You can place down your entrance in front of you and
    choose where your exit will go on your map.
  - Your map will be obscured by the haze. Find other people to talk to. They may
    not be all there anymore, but they're familiar with where they've been. They
    can clear your path.
  - You best start finding a way out before you end up lost like the rest.
