Wash. D:

Sentence 1: HAVE YOU COME TO SEE MY WITTY STANDUP ROUTINE??? NO?? 

Sentence 2: FUCK! CANCEL CULTURE STRIKES AGAIN! JUST FUCKING LEAVE IF YOU'RE GONNA BE A WOKE SNOWFLAKE!!!

Tabbes:

Sentence 1: Oh yeah I know all about this place. On another note, did you know that one in seven people don't like eating raw meat? Crazy!

Sentence 2: Hm? The haze? Isn't that the thing that kills halos?

Eepy:

Sentence 1: Oh noble traveller, whither art thou's soul, stranded in yon labyrnth of thine mind's arcane sorcery?

Sentence 2: Bid adiue and fairest blessings. May thou unmask yon deceit veiled beneath ye maze.

Bubsy Wubsy Jr:

Sentence 1: I swear to whatever unholy god rules this fucking ***-filled dimension that I will personally tear out the still beating spleen of whatever ********* thought it would be funny to

Sentence 2: Yeah you'll need to go that way. Not like this god forsaken shithole will indicate that to you of its own accord like the fucking ****** **** it is.

Glorp:

Sentence 1: I remember a video where some guy said that you can beat any maze just by hugging the walls for long enough. 

Sentence 2: Started doing that about... ten... trillion years ago? Hasn't panned out so far.

Sentence 3: Oh yeah I remember that spot. Circled it for a good milennia or two before I started recognizing the four pixels in the bottom right.

Guy Who Got His Head Chopped Off Like Holy Fuck:

Sentence 1: Oh! Heyheyheyheyhey! Whats uuuuup? Oh this? NOTHING! HAHA! Just chilling. NOT LIKE MY FFFFFFFFFuuuAAAAAAAreaking head is TOTALLY NOT CHOPPED OFF!

Sentence 2: WHERE ARE YOU?! ONE METER ABOVE ME BUDDY! HA! TALL JOKE! AGH GOD, I AM IN INCREDIBLE PAIN!

raybobson@yahoo.com:

Sentence 1: Hey, man. Be careful around here. Bumped into some chick and she called my fit "mid". Never been so distraught in my life.

Sentence 2: Yeah, she was two blocks down. Be careful, bro.

Princess Anastasia Von Moya:

Sentence 1: HOW DARE YOU ENTER MY PRESENCE, PLEBIAN! DON'T YOU KNOW I HAVE PHANTOM PAIN™?!

Sentence 2: MY DAD'S GONNA BAN YOUR ASS FROM THIS PLANE OF EXISTENCE! EXIT'S THAT WAY IF YOU VALUE YOUR MORTAL SOUL, USERPER!

KCJVRYcN:

Sentence 1: The socio-pseudosystem that parades my extravagant slippers pursues a flow of riches in spite of that which I may cater.

Sentence 2: An escape from tomorrow's grasp on the yestermorrow acts at the behest of thine penmanship. Forever more, soldier.

Wubsy Bubsy Sr:

Sentence 1: Gee golly gosh I am just so flippin' cheery right now! There's nothing better than a nice ambient space to hear your own thoughts judge you.

Sentence 2: Why I'd be happy to lend a hand stranger. After all, helping your own hallucinations only makes sense.

xX_LordofDarkness_Xx:

Sentence 1: Ugh, the only thing as cooked as being stranded in hell is having to hang around with these mid losers.

Sentence 2: Sure, whatever. Go that way. Anywhere that gets you away from me, negative aura bozo.

Mac:

Sentence 1: Woah, buddy. You good? You probably don't know where you are. I honestly don't either. My best guess is it's some sort of computerized hell meant to imprison us. 

Sentence 2: There's no getting outta here unless you've still got all your mental faculties intact. This labrynth eats away at people's minds.

Sentence 3: The maze is nothing but dead ends. You'll need to find some programs to help you make doorways through the walls. They looked like vending machines, last I checked. 

Sentence 4: They'll give you the ability to make holes wherever you want in the maze, as long as it isn't obscured by the haze. 

Sentence 5: They're a one time use each so use them wisely. Otherwise you'll need to pick up your entrance and put it somewhere else.

Sentence 6: Place your entrance wherever you want in front of you, then place your exit on the map. Try to ask around for help with clearing the haze first.

Sentence 7: The haze is this... sort of fuzz that distorts the map. It's how most of us got lost. Only people who've around it long enough know their way through it.

Sentence 8: You should try talking to the people. Most of them kind of lost themselves but they can help clear up your path. 

Sentence 9: After you've cleared a section of the haze, try placing your exit door there. Do that enough times and you may yet find an escape from this digital damnation.

Door Machine:

1: OW, FUCK! MY CORPUS CALLOSUM!

2: Hello, how can I- AGH!

3: Do you know about the D-O-R-E?

4: Don't go spending it all in one place.

5: My lobotomy wasn't scheduled until next Tuesday.

6: Now in 16K quality textures with over 200 million polygons. (Requires 120GB of storage space, an SSD, 32GB of ram, an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 graphics card and an Intel Core i7-12700 processor).

7: Geez this is worse than that time I was a door machine trapped in a maze.

8: Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...

11: I once knew a guy called the muffin man.

12: What are we? Some kind of "Haze.exe"?
